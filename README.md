# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Weather-App
Welcome to the Weather App! This application allows users to input a location and view weather information for that location.

### About The Project

This Project shows us the weather of any city, just enter the name of a city around the world to get the current weather condtions.

I have used ReactJs Library for building this application along with HTML and CSS for making the good user interface and fetched the open weather api using Javascript for getting the current weather deatils on input city name. 

### Steps to run Project Locally
